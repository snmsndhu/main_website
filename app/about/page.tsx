      <p>
        I came to Canada in 2016 as a student, and the journey was not easy,
        there were lots of up's and down's, but with the support from the family
        i survived and now when i think about it, I feel like was a fun ride.
        Hard times make the Tought man and Tought man makes the Hard time easy.
